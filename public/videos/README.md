Video assets
============

Place site-hosted videos in this folder. They are served at "/videos/...".

Recommendations:
- Use MP4 (H.264) for broad support; optional WebM (VP9/AV1) for smaller size
- Keep each file ≤ 10–20 MB for performance
- 1080p, 24–30 fps, ~6–8 Mbps bitrate is usually enough
- Short 10–20s loops work best for hero backgrounds
- Mute audio to allow autoplay on mobile (we already set muted/playsInline)

Example used by the recreational page:
- MP4: /videos/drone-recreational.mp4
- Optional poster: /videos/drone-recreational-poster.jpg
